# Final Project 

## Overview
This project goes the many variables associated with obtaining heart disease and tries to determine what, if any, correlation they have with one another, specificially the variable of having heart disease or not. 

## Question 
With the magnitude of how deadly heart disease is, and how it occurs prematurely in many cases, what, if any, are indicators to help pre diagnose individuals who share attributes with those who have heart disease?

## Objectives
1. Find how attributes correlate with risk of heart disease by taking the average of the HeartDisease column for the different attributes.
2. Predict an individualâ€™s risk of heart disease based on its variables using our correlation calculations, evaluating the variables through a decision tree or binary logistic regression model.

## Instructions 
1. The HeartDiseaseFinal file is our concluded work, and our work has been shown in a very step by step order
2. Each of our own individual work is also within this file with our last name distinguishing who did what, there are extra graphs and EDA within them, but our best accumulative work is within the final file.
